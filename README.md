# K-Typo
- This is a repository for investigating the performance degradation of Korean LLM when affected by the __K-Typo__, a term referring to typographical errors that can occur in __"Korean"__.
- Furthermore, we plan to build an LLM that is robust to K-Typo, aiming to enhance its helpfulness in environments that demand safe and reliable inference.

## Structure
- The [Datasets](https://github.com/CAU-AI-Project-Team5/K-Typo/tree/main/Datasets) directory contains datasets for inference, fine-tuning and evaluation. Specifically, We introduce typographical errors into our original datasets to investigate their impact on our model's performance.
- The [Code](https://github.com/CAU-AI-Project-Team5/K-Typo/tree/main/Code) directory encompasses Python files used for *training, evaluation and dataset-modification*.
- The [Results](https://github.com/CAU-AI-Project-Team5/K-Typo/tree/main/Results) directory stores evaluation results, including the scores for each subset and answer to all the question.
